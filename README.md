## üîß Technical Highlights

### 1. Strategic Pivot: From Scraping to API

**Initial Plan**: Complex web scraper using Puppeteer to gather market data from OKCountyRecords.com.

**The Discovery**: Site offered an official (though undocumented) API.

**The Decision**: Pivoted to API integration for production stability.

**Rationale**: Demonstrates ability to choose the right tool for the job, prioritizing robustness over unnecessary complexity. Original scraper code remains in project history.

### 2. Two-Step AI Pipeline Architecture

**Step 1 - AI Extraction** (`lease-extractor.service.js`):

- "Dumb" extractor focused solely on data extraction
- Converts raw PDF text to structured JSON

**Step 2 - AI Analysis** (`lease-analyzer.service.js`):

- Sophisticated analysis using clean JSON + market data
- Generates comprehensive four-part reports

**Rationale**: Separation of concerns improves reliability and analysis quality.

### 3. Demo-Optimized Seed Data Strategy

**Challenge**: OCC website's robust anti-scraping measures made live data unreliable for demos.

**Solution**: Implemented "Operator Intelligence" using realistic seed data in `operator_activity` table.

**Rationale**: Pragmatic approach ensuring reliable demo experience while proving the concept.
